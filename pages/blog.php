			<h2>2010-07-29 - Bug fix: Uploading files with "strange" characters</h2>
			<p>For a long time it's been impossible to upload files with "strange"
			characters. This should be fixed now, though we've only done some minor
			testing. Please feel free to upload files with "&aring;" or "&auml;" etc in the filename.</p>

			<h2>2010-07-19 - Virus checking added</h2>
			<p>Added virus checking on uploaded files.</p>

			<h2>2010-02-10 - Bug fixes</h2>
			<p>A few bugs have been squashed recently. Delete works properly
			again, and delete link has been removed from public listing.
			Also added detailed info on the extra options, the full description
			is shown as a tooltip in file lists and did some minor html changes.
			Backend code has been updated as well, to increase stability.</p>

			<h2>2009-04-19 - New features: Public files and emailing</h2>
			<p>Files can now be set to public so that they show up in the
		        public file listing. It's now also possible to enter an email
                        address to send information about the file to upon upload.
			Added a proper 404 page when a file wasn't found.
			When deleting files, a full page with information is shown.</p>

			<h2>2009-04-16 - New feature: Share link</h2>
			<p>On the upload page we've added links to some popular online services
			to share your link. At the moment it is possible to share the link on
			Facebook, post to Twitter and create a TinyUrl.</p>
			<p>More social bookmarking sites and services might be added in the 
			future.</p>

			<h2>2009-03-18 - Update: Filename added to URL</h2>
			<p>A new feature has been implemented. The filename of an uploaded file
			can be appended to the URL, which will then be used as the filename of
			the file when it is downloaded.</p>
			<p>Also fixed so that images are displayed inline in the browser
			instead of being downloaded. Some time in the future we might add
			a viewing page as well.</p>
