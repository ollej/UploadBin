			<h1>2009-04-16 - New feature: Share link</h1>
			<p>On the upload page we've added links to some popular online services
			to share your link. At the moment it is possible to share the link on
			Facebook, post to Twitter and create a TinyUrl.</p>
			<p>More social bookmarking sites and services might be added in the 
			future.</p>

			<h1>2009-03-18 - Update: Filename added to URL</h1>
			<p>A new feature has been implemented. The filename of an uploaded file
			can be appended to the URL, which will then be used as the filename of
			the file when it is downloaded.</p>
			<p>Also fixed so that images are displayed inline in the browser
			instead of being downloaded. Some time in the future we might add
			a viewing page as well.</p>
