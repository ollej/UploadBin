			<h1>2009-03-18 - Update: Filename added to URL</h1>
			<p>A new feature has been implemented. The filename of an uploaded file
			can be appended to the URL, which will then be used as the filename of
			the file when it is downloaded.</p>
			<p>Also fixed so that images are displayed inline in the browser
			instead of being downloaded. Some time in the future we might add
			a viewing page as well.</p>
